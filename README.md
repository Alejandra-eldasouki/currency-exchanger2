## Currency Exchanger

### Description

Currency Exchanger is a web application that allows users to convert U.S. dollars to various other currencies. Users can enter an amount in U.S. dollars and select a target currency, and the application will fetch the latest exchange rate from an API to perform the conversion. The converted amount is then displayed to the user.
